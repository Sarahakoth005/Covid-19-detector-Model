# Covid-19-detector-Model

According to World Health Organization, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell

# Symptoms

Fever

Cough

Tiredness

Loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Headache

Aches and pains

Diarrhoea

A rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes

Red or irritated eyes.

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Loss of speech or mobility, or confusion

Chest pain.

# Prevention

To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 

Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.

Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.

Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.

Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.

Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.

Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.

# MODEL CREATION 
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for COVID-19 detection using X-ray images. The model was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular deep learning frameworks in Python.

The goal of the model is to classify X-ray images into two classes: "COVID-19 positive" and "COVID-19 negative" (normal). The CNN architecture was chosen for this task due to its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

The main steps of the model creation process are as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: I obtained a dataset containing X-ray images of patients with COVID-19 and normal X-ray images. Before feeding the data into the model, I performed preprocessing steps such as resizing the images to a consistent shape, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture**: I designed the CNN architecture using Keras. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers to extract essential features from the images. The convolutional layers use various filters to detect patterns and features at different scales. Dropout layers were also added to prevent overfitting.

3. **Compilation**: After defining the CNN architecture, I compiled the model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification), an optimizer (e.g., Adam), and a metric (e.g., accuracy) to monitor during training.

4. **Model Training**: The model was trained using the training dataset. During training, the model learned to optimize the defined loss function by adjusting its internal parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent.

5. **Validation**: To monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting, I used the validation dataset. The model's accuracy and loss on the validation set were computed after each epoch.

6. **Model Evaluation**: After training, I evaluated the model's performance on a separate test dataset. This dataset was not used during training or validation and provided an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.

7. **Results**: The trained CNN model achieved promising results in COVID-19 detection from X-ray images. It demonstrated high accuracy and performed well on the test dataset, indicating its potential as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 screening.

8. **Further Improvements**: Depending on the specific dataset and use case, further improvements could be explored, such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, different CNN architectures (e.g., transfer learning), or ensemble methods to enhance the model's performance.

Overall, this CNN model for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images using TensorFlow, Keras, and CNNs can be a valuable tool in aiding medical professionals in diagnosing COVID-19 cases and potentially helping to control the spread of the virus.
